## Hashing & Encryption

Hashing is a one-way function that converts a string into a fixed-length
and purpose to protect data in a way that is irreversible and used for
data integrity or verification.

Encryption is a two-way function that converts a string into a
fixed-length and purpose to protect data in a way that allows it to be
recovered (decrypted) when needed.
